### Aside

This was my first React project. Before using React I completed projects using Angluar framework. This was a great learning experience and an awesome way to dip into a framework I have been wanting to try to learn. While I was not able to visualize the data on the page, I was able to get a successful API response with all the data as well as learn how to use some libraries. I hope you can take my lack of experience with React into consideration. Thank you for your time! 


### TODO
-Add functionality to the DatePicker: when a date is selected, the value is then compaired to dates from API (stored inside an array)which loops through to find the matching date which in turn renders that data on the page. 
-Add in the data visualization portion of this project 
-Continue stlying project 
-I would like to also add an about section to explain what Biobot does and how they are working with the communities around them
